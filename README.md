<p><b>My idea</b> - it is a mobile application for visitors of Almaty city.</p>
<p>Project description: When people will come to the city and will not know anything about history, best places to eat or about cultural places to spend their time, they will use this application. First of all, they will have choice between list of categories, such as:</p>
<ul>
  	<li>	Nature</li>
	<li>	Parks</li>
	<li>	Nature places</li>
	<li>	Eating</li>
	<li>	Restaurants </li>
	<li>	Cafes</li> 
	<li>	Activities</li> 
	<li>	 Cinema</li>
	<li>	Bowling</li>
	<li>	Table tennis</li>
	<li>	Taxi</li>
	<li>	Halyk</li>
	<li>	Lider</li>
	<li>	Hotels</li>
	<li>	Kazakhstan</li>
	<li>	Ritz Palas</li>
	<li>	Shops</li>
	<li>	Mega </li>
	<li>	Dostyk plaza</li>
	<li>	Silk way city</li>
</ul>

<p>By using this application, they will have necessary information for tourists. Address, price, photos of the place.
In addition, they will have “личный кабинет”, where they can change information about them and opportunity to send their recommendations for developers.</p>
